# iTV

iTV is a tvOS application that aggregates several Iranian video on demand platforms. The project currently displays a simple list of supported platforms and uses localized Persian strings. Each provider is implemented as a separate module and references a logo asset. Binary image files are omitted from the repository, so the app falls back to system symbols as placeholders.

## Platforms

- Filimo
- Namava
- Film Net
- Star Net
